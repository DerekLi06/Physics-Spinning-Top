# AP_Physics_Project

'''
Objectives:
 - Our program's objective is to simulate a spinning top in the form of a cylindrical cone that moves accurately according to real physics. 
 - Our spinning top will demonstrate physics concepts that include torque, inertia, angular momentum, precession, nutation, and friction and more
   that all work together to create a functional spinning top

Instructions/Controls:
1. When you first run the program, the simulation will be locked so that you can modify certain properties of the spinning top via sliders
   to manipulate the simulation of the spinning top as you see fit.
2. You will have 4 sliders, one for Mass, Omega0 (Initial Angular Velocity), Initial Tilt Angle, and the Frictional Coefficient. These sliders
   can be modified within a certain range before the start of the simulation, which will result in different outcomes.
3. Once you've finished deciding on the properties of your spinning top, you can lock them in by pressing the button right below them that reads 
   "Click me to lock in your top properties!" Once you click this button, you will not be able to modify the sliders anymore.
4. Afterwards, you can click anywhere within the canvas of the simulation to start it. Before you click, there will be a pause symbol at the 
   bottom right of the canvas indicating that the simulation is paused. Once you click, that pause button will disappear.
5. Directly below the canvas is a key which indicates what eac arrow in the simulation represents. Red for the angular momentum, blue for the
   tangent line, yellow for the trail of the top's axis, and green for the vertical axis
6. Once the simulation begins, you can move your view of the simulation anyway you like, whether you want to zoom closer for farther from the top,
   or move the angle you're viewing it from.
7. Once the simulation has started, two new buttons will also appear at the bottom of the screen, which will read "Pause" and "Reset"
   - You can press "Pause" to pause and unpause the simulation at any time.
   - You can press "Reset" at any time to completely reset the simulation to the very beginning, locking the canvas and unlocking the 4 sliders
